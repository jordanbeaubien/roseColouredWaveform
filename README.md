It was written in Python 3.9.12 and should work in any current Python 3.x

The libraries are all common and can be easily installed via pip/pip3 on the command line.

  librosa - "pip install librosa"
  https://pypi.org/project/librosa/

  numpy - "pip install numpy"
  https://pypi.org/project/numpy/

In order to use rcw on your machine, simply navigate to the cloned directory housing 
both "rcw.py" and "userfacing.py" in your local drive. Enter "python rcw.py" on the 
command line (or, "python3 rcw.py" depending on your machines path and file structure). 
As long as the four above libraries are available to the python running on your machine 
the program should operate as expected.

  `/roseColouredWaveform/__RCW__/rcw.py`
 ` /roseColouredWaveform/__RCW__/userfacing.py`
